I especially like their plants in the building. It creates an amazing atmosphere on the building giving positive vibes. Their clothes are also quite affordable and of top quality. I have visited many outlets of Khaadi with my family and I have always been impressed with the plants and the building architecture. Hope they always manage real plants and don't go for fake plants like many others.,9 months ago

In the '80s the only store that I knew existed was in Pookadai. I used to buy honey in thick glass bottles(not presentable). There was then a reputation that Khadi honey is pure and harvested from farmers. In the next years, after the '90s, I could not buy from Khadi as I live in Singapore. However in my recent trip last week, after trying many different brands of honey, I decided to buy again from Khadi hoping that they live up to the past reputation of selling pure honey.
I was amazed that they had such a vast variety of products, and homegrown groceries too!
I wish them success and hope they continue to expand nearer to the consumer.",a month ago

I have visited their self service  Supermarket. Great quality products starting from organic snacks to provisional items to soaps to Nilgiris ucliptus tea  , natural honey, oththukuli ghee..wow lots of great quality products & varities which we can't miss out. Majority doesn't know this place because of show room appeal. Show room looks like 19th century place. Not sure why nobody putting effort to improve this aesthetically.
Coming to billing, typical government staffs & demotivated employees. Only one counter and there is a big queue. After billing, you have to step out for cashier (luckily , fortunately, they are accepting cards) then you have to show the slip to delivery counter to collect your items.
They could have brought several items into Online selling to avoid this crowd. Also, they should provide contactless payment like UPI bar code etc which is now a days street side vendor is doing..
Very importantly, govt should encourage all employees to buy home stuffs from here by providing coupons, gift card etc. This way, all these kadhi bhavan can become more profitable and make touch completion against all private players.
Most importantly, put young energetic staffs atleast in Supermarket/cashier section to appease customers. Current staffs still think they are the customers and we are the devotees . This attitude should change.
Considering the product quality & supporting our  own farmers & weavers , request to purchase here more often though we have above constraints..",2 years ago

The protector costs $75.90 for a phablet.

Bought and applied on 28 July 2022 (Thursday). Entire process is around an hour. Due to the application issues, there was a scratch on the screen protector. Resend on 29 July 2022 (Friday) for re-application. The entire process took over an hour.

During the second application, the staff handed back the phone to me for check, for which I assumed that the job was completed. After seeing some poor finishing, he than mentioned he was just showing me the phone to check. I was like “check what” if it was not completed. Why don’t you complete the job before letting me check the finishing?

After the second completion, still not satisfied with the application, I asked him if this was how the product is supposed to look after it is completed. He mentioned yes. After debating for a few rounds, he told me to go and write a Google review if I am still not satisfied. I was like wow, great way to speak to your customers. I said thank you and left. For clarity, I left because the staff told me that the application of the screen protector is as good as it gets so.

For your information, pictures were taken on 30 July 2022 (1 day after application). I let the pictures do the talking, cause for the price, expected the finishing to be much better. If this was $10 or $20, I can close one eye. But $75.90 for a screen protector is pricey and IMO, I expected a lot more.

Also, these pictures were taken one day after, so you can imagine how well the protectors hold.

I do see their staff genuinely trying to help, doing their best to rectify the issues, could have been a tad bit more apologetic though. But fundamentally speaking, I think that there is a product flaw as the protector does not apply smoothly across all the surfaces. This could be due to the phone curves edge but in this case, don’t sell for this model. If you are going to charge $75.90, the customer is going to expect more for the product.

The $10 lifetime warranty is not useful too. If the product is fundamentally flawed, no point giving lifetime warranty as it does not solve the product issue in the first place.

Your phone is also going to be very hot after application as they use a heat dryer for application.

Overall, not too great an experience, but guess this is as good as it is going to get. Almost 3 hours and $75.90 loss, let my loss be your gain. Customer service also does not make up for the entire experience. Skip the product, just go somewhere else.

2 out of 5 starts and do not recommend.

And, I walked around the mall, went for my lunch and during my lunch, whipped out my iPad to see what was shown in the photo. It's not even wipe marks anymore, just bubbles. I mean, even film on my Samsung phone from other shop isn't of this quality.

This was when out of curiosity, I googled and read many of the similar poor reviews. I didn't even bother with the lifetime warranty anymore because I thought this film wasn't suitable for scribbling with an apple pencil too. So, I went ahead to iStudio on the 2nd level to change to tempered glass. That's of course, another hefty sum, but at least, worth spending as compared to this.",3 months ago

And most importantly I noticed the protector itself is very sensitive to water, there is once my hand is slightly watery due to rain and one of the corner of the protector just fall off immediately after I touches my phone. At the end I have to 'repair' them myself by slowly pushing it back. So theoretically now my phone is splashproof, but my phone protector is not, lol. And they never mentioned this when I purchase at their counter

According to their life time warranty policy, I will have to pay $10 each time if I need to go back and ask them to readjust the protector. As a consumer I don't think it worth the money consider I only used it for less than 3 months.

Overall I think it is a good solution, the material is really good and tough like they declared, just it has some problems to resolve before you can put it into daily usage,

1. The protector is so easy to fall off from the edges since your hand touches it everyday
2. It is too sensitive to water

Hope they can come out something that can resolve the 2 issues mentioned above, and before that, I think you should consider other protector option in the market",a year ago

Overall its just ok because now they manufacture/import those type of clothes whose quality will not last for atleast even 2 years. Because now a days they focus on the customers to buy more n more.

Nowadays it feels like beating in the cheapest McDonald's.

Their baristas are not well trained, their only goal is to make drinks as fast and effortless as possible. I ordered an Espresso frappuccino that looked practically white and tasted like plain syrup. When I told them something was off they told me they can charge me for another. They ended up doing it again without charge, but the same, I could see how they got a lot of leftovers which means they either over milked it or over iced it.

On top of that, the place is messy and dirty; I know that is in part the fault of tourists not being clean, but that also talked of an unwillingness to hire enough staff to keep things running right.

The atmosphere is off. The A/C at the highest, likes purposely trying to make it as less cozy as possible so you leave immediately. Long are the days where Sbux was a cozy inviting place with jazz music in the background.

For such an expensive coffee, I'm expecting nothing out of the ordinary; just the same quality they were known for",4 months ago

Yes. In my quest for a 2023 Yelpie, no business, park, street corner, subway line, or entity is safe. I’m coming for everything they said I couldn’t have.

This starbucks is right next to my office, and tbh is always a bit lagging for a typical starbucks. I find myself often checking how long I have been in here while waiting for my tall cold brew. Well, grande cold brew this morning if I’m being realy honest.
But I feel them, it’s a starbucks in midtown. That has to be like working on an assembly line in the middle of World War II lol.
The staff is super nice though and they have cool mugs. Wish I could give 3.5 stars. But I’ll give 4 F it.

The person at the register seemed confused and asked me to repeat the name of the drink five times. My husband ended up showing him the sign on top of the fridge with the drink's name and image, which he seemed to know nothing about. I guess that was a sign not to order, but it was our fault for still doing so. Since I don't drink caffeine, I ordered a regular decaf iced coffee with cream and sugar. I double-checked and asked if decaf was doable, and he said, yeah ofc. We ordered two drinks, which cost around $14. For two drinks? Insane, but that's the reality of this crazy economy. We waited, and when our drinks came out, we tasted them. My husband's drink was way too sweet, and mine tasted a little off. So, I asked the barista if my drink was decaf. He said no, as they only offer decaf espresso, not decaf iced coffee. So, why did he take the order and confirm he could do decaf iced coffee? We basically wasted $14.

Well, Maya, I don’t owe you any pleasantries when you’ve been rude to me before. Now, she’s acting like she’s the victim, trying to blame me and pretend she’s being nice. It’s honestly pathetic. When I don’t respond, she just says “ha” in a condescending way, completely lacking any sense of basic etiquette.

Her behavior isn’t just annoying—it’s affecting the whole place. I’ve noticed her coworkers losing tips because of her, and frankly, I’m not tipping while she’s around. I’m sure other customers feel the same way. Maya acts like she’s in charge, but let me make this clear: she’s not. If you’re unhappy in your job, Maya, it might be time to quit.

Yes your former physical named gold card holder. I might still have the card in my old wallet. Only reason I re-downloaded the app and decided to place an order today was because someone at work gifted me a Starbucks gift card.

Order placed 9:35am on the app as I'm walking into the store, a simple Venti Pike with half and half. For some reason, app tells me it'll be ready at 9:47am. No clue why it would take 12 mins but ok. Maybe the app is over-compensating and it'll be ready early. Nope.

9:47am hits. App tells me that my order's ready. The board in the shop tells me it is ready. But no coffee with my name appears. 9:53am, no coffee. Finally I manage to get an employee's attention. Maybe somebody else took my cup. No she tells me that her colleague is working on it. Well the app said it was ready 6 minutes ago. So someone's lying. Finally get my coffee at 9:56am.

21 minutes from order to pickup for a simple coffee that any local NYC deli would fill in 30 seconds. What is this company doing? How are they so horribly mismanaged?

And the worst part, I still have a balance of $20.70 left on the app.",a month ago

They clearly see me waiting right in front of the door but don’t say anything. At 5:40AM another customer comes and has to start banging on the window multiple times for them to sign through the glass that they’ve decided to open at 6AM today instead of 5:30AM as listed on the door and online. Completely understand things happen in a business. Employee could call out, short on supplies, etc. However, common sense and common courtesy would say to put a sign on the door or have a 5 second conversation with your customer waiting outside your door.

First off, the staff seemed uninterested and not very friendly. I understand everyone has off days, but it felt like they were just going through the motions rather than providing good customer service.

The order I placed took much longer than expected, and when I finally received my coffee, it was lukewarm at best. It’s hard to enjoy a drink when it’s not even at the right temperature, and to make matters worse, the coffee was watered down and lacked flavor.

I also decided to grab a breakfast sandwich, and it was awful. The bread was soggy, the eggs tasted bland, and the overall sandwich had an unpleasant, stale taste. It’s safe to say it wasn’t worth the price, and I couldn’t even finish it.

The cleanliness of the store was also lacking. There were crumbs and spilled drinks on the counter, and the tables weren’t wiped down properly. I’ve come to expect better from a Starbucks, but this location didn’t live up to the usual standards.

All in all, it was a frustrating visit, and I’m unlikely to return anytime soon. There are other coffee options on Roosevelt Island that are far more welcoming and offer better quality beverages and food.",a week ago

Staffs are so unprofessional and rude!!!
Baddest experience ever!!!
This morning I stopped by the store and ordered a coffee and a sandwich. I waited my sandwich 10 mins there and everyone else ordered behind me all gotten there, so I wanted to ask the lady who’s taking sandwiches out, but she kept away from me and looked didn’t want to hear me. I wanted 3 mins more and since I was late to work so I went to the counter and asked for refund because I have to go.
BUT! The rudest thing happened! A black lady with red or pink shirt on her started pointing at me with the sandwich tung on her hand yelled at me saying they can’t do a refund for me and told me to wait until she finishes her work. That was ridiculous! And all other staffs hang there they started to join and fight against me to let me be patient. What situation is this??? So I have to be stuck there for another 5 more minutes to get refunded. And she even refunded wrong amount to me. I was too mad how they’re being so disrespectful. So I called store number to complain about this situation, but the guy picked up the phone was not taking the call seriously and made fun of me saying I should be early if I didn’t want to late to work.

Nowadays it feels like beating in the cheapest McDonald's.

Their baristas are not well trained, their only goal is to make drinks as fast and effortless as possible. I ordered an Espresso frappuccino that looked practically white and tasted like plain syrup. When I told them something was off they told me they can charge me for another. They ended up doing it again without charge, but the same, I could see how they got a lot of leftovers which means they either over milked it or over iced it.

On top of that, the place is messy and dirty; I know that is in part the fault of tourists not being clean, but that also talked of an unwillingness to hire enough staff to keep things running right.

The atmosphere is off. The A/C at the highest, likes purposely trying to make it as less cozy as possible so you leave immediately. Long are the days where Sbux was a cozy inviting place with jazz music in the background.

Yes. In my quest for a 2023 Yelpie, no business, park, street corner, subway line, or entity is safe. I’m coming for everything they said I couldn’t have.

This starbucks is right next to my office, and tbh is always a bit lagging for a typical starbucks. I find myself often checking how long I have been in here while waiting for my tall cold brew. Well, grande cold brew this morning if I’m being realy honest.
But I feel them, it’s a starbucks in midtown. That has to be like working on an assembly line in the middle of World War II lol.
The staff is super nice though and they have cool mugs. Wish I could give 3.5 stars. But I’ll give 4 F it.

The person at the register seemed confused and asked me to repeat the name of the drink five times. My husband ended up showing him the sign on top of the fridge with the drink's name and image, which he seemed to know nothing about. I guess that was a sign not to order, but it was our fault for still doing so. Since I don't drink caffeine, I ordered a regular decaf iced coffee with cream and sugar. I double-checked and asked if decaf was doable, and he said, yeah ofc. We ordered two drinks, which cost around $14. For two drinks? Insane, but that's the reality of this crazy economy. We waited, and when our drinks came out, we tasted them. My husband's drink was way too sweet, and mine tasted a little off. So, I asked the barista if my drink was decaf. He said no, as they only offer decaf espresso, not decaf iced coffee. So, why did he take the order and confirm he could do decaf iced coffee? We basically wasted $14. I didn’t bother asking for a different drink and just walked out.",5 months ago

Yes your former physical named gold card holder. I might still have the card in my old wallet. Only reason I re-downloaded the app and decided to place an order today was because someone at work gifted me a Starbucks gift card.

Order placed 9:35am on the app as I'm walking into the store, a simple Venti Pike with half and half. For some reason, app tells me it'll be ready at 9:47am. No clue why it would take 12 mins but ok. Maybe the app is over-compensating and it'll be ready early. Nope.

9:47am hits. App tells me that my order's ready. The board in the shop tells me it is ready. But no coffee with my name appears. 9:53am, no coffee. Finally I manage to get an employee's attention. Maybe somebody else took my cup. No she tells me that her colleague is working on it. Well the app said it was ready 6 minutes ago. So someone's lying. Finally get my coffee at 9:56am.

21 minutes from order to pickup for a simple coffee that any local NYC deli would fill in 30 seconds. What is this company doing? How are they so horribly mismanaged?

Great location for where I was staying, though that said, you can’t walk 5 meters in New York without passing a coffee shop so I’m not sure the location counts.

The prices were pretty reasonable and not too much more than the in smaller cities.

Pros: The bakery is fully stocked, including the cold pressed drinks. The workers are fast and friendly.

Cons: No easy access parking before 6 pm. Limited in store seating due to tons of people planted for the day.

Overall, definitely worth a trip if you are in the area and need a refresher!",2 years ago

Attempted to open the door at 5:30AM on 11/6/24, two employees made eye contact with me but the door was locked. They looked busy so I didn’t bother them. They clearly see me waiting right in front of the door but don’t say anything. At 5:40AM another customer comes and has to start banging on the window multiple times for them to sign through the glass that they’ve decided to open at 6AM today instead of 5:30AM as listed on the door and online. Completely understand things happen in a business. Employee could call out, short on supplies, etc. However, common sense and common courtesy would say to put a sign on the door or have a 5 second conversation with your customer waiting outside your door. Were they planning on having me wait outside for 30 minutes? If someone is going to get coffee at 5:30AM in NYC, they likely have things to do and can’t afford to wait around.

First off, the staff seemed uninterested and not very friendly. I understand everyone has off days, but it felt like they were just going through the motions rather than providing good customer service.

The order I placed took much longer than expected, and when I finally received my coffee, it was lukewarm at best. It’s hard to enjoy a drink when it’s not even at the right temperature, and to make matters worse, the coffee was watered down and lacked flavor.

I also decided to grab a breakfast sandwich, and it was awful. The bread was soggy, the eggs tasted bland, and the overall sandwich had an unpleasant, stale taste. It’s safe to say it wasn’t worth the price, and I couldn’t even finish it.

The cleanliness of the store was also lacking. There were crumbs and spilled drinks on the counter, and the tables weren’t wiped down properly. I’ve come to expect better from a Starbucks, but this location didn’t live up to the usual standards.

All in all, it was a frustrating visit, and I’m unlikely to return anytime soon. There are other coffee options on Roosevelt Island that are far more welcoming and offer better quality beverages and food.",a week ago

Third time I’m here for costumized drink and everything changed. The first two times there’s always a lady like an angel smiling at me and prepared me my beautiful drinks around 6 dollars. Today firstly everyone was so cold but I understand cuz they work a lot and got heavy workload. But then they raised my drink’s price and later I argued they said this should be the original price but they don’t know my friend got it in 4 dollars in NYC in another Starbucks LOL. I understand 6-7 is normal bcuz I could clearly saw before how the lady added price. But this time LOL. And later they gave me a tiny bottle like 1/2 of the normal box. After I argued they gave me ok right size but no taste of matcha and milk AT ALL only sugar and the strawberry purée was so thick. PlUS AT LEAST HALF BOTTLE IS ICE LOL. Before today this is my dream Starbucks but now just LOL. (p1 and p3 is before. p2 is today you can clearly see there’s almost no matcha lol) so mean to an Asian girl SHAME ON YOU RACISTS

I wanted 3 mins more and since I was late to work so I went to the counter and asked for refund because I have to go.
BUT! The rudest thing happened! A black lady with red or pink shirt on her started pointing at me with the sandwich tung on her hand yelled at me saying they can’t do a refund for me and told me to wait until she finishes her work. That was ridiculous! And all other staffs hang there they started to join and fight against me to let me be patient. What situation is this??? So I have to be stuck there for another 5 more minutes to get refunded. And she even refunded wrong amount to me. I was too mad how they’re being so disrespectful.
